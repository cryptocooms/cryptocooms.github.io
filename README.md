This was a shitpost NFT project from a number of years ago. It's incredibly stupid and there's not much else to say about it.

### ðŸ’¦ The CryptoCooms NFT Collection ðŸ’¦

The CryptoCooms NFT Collection is a surreal representation of the beauty, diversity, and storied history of the crypto market. With the utmost care and delicacy, each sticky gob of coom was handcrafted into a beautiful masterwork. The collection is a limited edition of only sixty-nine pieces.

CryptoCooms are more than just art. They are a feeling - the feeling of seeing long green bars on a candlestick chart. The green waves of light gracefully warm your eyes as you let out a scream born from pure euphoria. A flow leaves your earthly body as you come into a sublime realm of greatness and wonder. You have an indescribable mental clarity you cannot quantify. Floating weightlessly, you find yourself suspended among the stars in a timeless instant that seems like forever. Then it passes, and you are gently pushed back into your seat, covered in CryptoCooms.
